Build 47
	* Added `s3UploadDelay` property to delay the start of an upload to allow for cases where a stream is re-published. Default value is 0
	* Added `s3UploadFilePrefix` property to specify a path to upload the files to. Default not set
	* Added `s3UploadVersionFile` property to control file versioning. When enabled, we will check to see if the file exists in the s3 bucket and add an incrementing version number to the new uploaded file as required. Default is false (don't version)
	* Added `s3UploadDebugLog` property to enable extra debug logging

Build 46
	* Added method to restart failed uploads after a timeout without having to wait for an appInstance restart

		* Added Integer Property `s3UploadRestartFailedUploadTimeout`. Default 60000
	* Streamlined upload initialisation so all uploads use a single method
	* Fixed bug in file search so that subfolders are indexed correctly

Build 45
	* Fixed problem with extracting mediaName where leading separator chars were not being removed on Windows platforms

Build 44
	* Fixed module initialisation error caused by missing property values
	* Changed method used to shutdown the transfer manager so that the S3Client isn't closed immediately which was throwing a socket exception if there are active transfers
